# Sleek, a chatbot for Slack

Sleek is a conversational agent to automate the delivery of surveys (e.g. for Ecological Momentary Assessments) in chat-based environments, such as Slack. The current version has an interface to communicate with the Slack API but the system was designed to support other chatbot APIs. Documentation coming soon...
